This plugin creates a widget that can be placed in any wigitized area of the theme. This gives the users the ability to shorten URL's.

== Description ==

TehGD is a URL shortening service. An API was created to allow other applications to use the URL shortening service. THis plugin uses its own special 
API to get the shortened URL.\n

The features of this plugin is that it gives two text boxes and a submit button. It then allows a user to enter a URL into the top text box and on the 
submit of the data the shortened URL is put into the second text box to allow the user to copy it.\n

The plugin does this by creating a widget which is then displayed in the widget section of the admin panel. This then allows you to drag the widget into 
a place where you have defined widgets to work.
